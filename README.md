## Gifwit support

Thanks to [@orderedlist](http://github.com/orderedlist), you can quickly access all the gifs in my repo via the handy OSX app [Gifwit](http://gifwit.com/). Just download the [library.gifwit](http://gifs.joelglovier.com/library.gifwit ) file and open in Gifwit. Gifwit will import all the gifs from the repo and you'll be able to easily access the production URLs via keyboard shortcuts. :zap:
